# TreesAndTents_ASP
A simple, generic solution to the Trees and Tents puzzle using ASP Clingo. 

### Source for the puzzle: https://www-janko-at.translate.goog/Raetsel/Zeltlager/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de

The **[SolutionCode.md](https://github.com/Harsh902/TreesAndTents_ASP/blob/main/SolutionCode.md)** contains *comments*, to help you *understand the logic*.

The **[Solution.md](https://github.com/Harsh902/TreesAndTents_ASP/blob/main/Solution.md)** contains the *screenshot*, and the *locations of the tents.*

You can also *directly download* the code from the **[treesAndTents.lp](https://github.com/Harsh902/TreesAndTents_ASP/blob/main/treesAndTents.lp)** and run it in Clingo.

I use Visual Studio which has a Clingo extension, but other IDEs should also work.
